* Two Files ... Raw Data and then optional averaging data.
* How to handle scenes that that aren't divisable by averaging interval?

Polling Class
-------------
Since we don't want to tie ourselves to closely to the Phigets hardware, there is an
AbstractPollingDevice class that contains the API for the polling devices. Right now 
the only subclass of that should be the "dummy file method" but when the hardward gets
here, I'll be able to create another subclass (PhidgetsPollingDevice) that will handle 
the various polling of the Phidgets hardware.

*API notes go here*
