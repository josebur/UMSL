TODO
----
* Poll Every Second ... Don't worry about averaging yet.
* Two Files ... Raw Data and then optional averaging data.
* How to handle scenes that that aren't divisable by averaging interval?

Polling Class
-------------
Since we don't want to tie ourselves to closely to the Phigets hardware, there is an
AbstractPollingDevice class that contains the API for the polling devices. Right now 
the only subclass of that should be the "dummy file method" but when the hardward gets
here, I'll be able to create another subclass (PhidgetsPollingDevice) that will handle 
the various polling of the Phidgets hardware.

Actually on second thought, I'll probably just code the PhidgetPollingDevice first
and tie this app to it and if the need to support new hardware comes along, I'll refactor the current code to use the Factory Method pattern to pick which hardware to use.

Phidget Polling Classes
-----------------------
- PhidgetInterfaceKit()
  Mostly just a wrapper around the CPhidgetInterfaceKit code.
  A Singleton class that is created when the app starts. 
attachHandler() - will be called when the devices are attached (see below).
detachHandler() - will be called when the devices are detached (see below).
errorHandler()  - will be called if there is ever an error of some kind.
init()		- sets up the InterfaceKit and registers the handlers.

- PhidgetSensor()
  Not much of a class.. not sure if will amount to much =)
isActive() - should this device be polled?
poll()	   - get the current value of the sensor

Relavent Functions for Phidgets Polling
---------------------------------------
CPhidgetInterfaceKit_getSensorCount(phid, &numSensors);

numSensors is the number of sensors supported by the board so in our case it will 
be 8.
Then the seat # will correspond to the InterfaceKit index of the Sensor
(e.g. Seat 1 -> Sensor Index 1).

int pollDevice(const Device &dev)
{
   int number = dev.number();
   int value;
   CPhidgetInterfaceKit_getSensorValue(phid, number, value);

   return value;
}

Attach and Detach
-----------------
I'll need to create handlers for attach and detach.
For attach I'll display a message to the console.
For detach, if there is a study in progress, I'll pause the study
and display a message saying that Seat #'s dial has been unplugged.
There will also be a message displayed to the console in either case.


On App Load
-----------
Probably after the database loads, I'll open the PhidgetsInterface and
have it display its various stats to the console.

On App Close
------------
I'll need to call CPhidget_close() and CPhidget_delete()

Values
------
0.0 - 10.0

0 - 1000

After the 1.0 Release
---------------------
* Make a separate UI to import/export the database.
  This should not be seen by the user of the application.
  Should probably be called something like UMSL-config or something
  along those lines.

* Use either a different method for showing the current progress of the study
  or smooth the animation of the timeline indicator.
* Create a temp file for storage of the data after the study has been run
  but the user hasn't saved it yet. Auto-recovery.
